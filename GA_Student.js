// Comparison between the new and older SudokuFitness to justify the new function

// Scenario 1: A 3*3 Sudoku is row-wise and square-wise perfect - only one of the columns has a value twice
// The older function will give a fitness of 81*2+9*8+8 = 242
// The newer function will give a fitness of 81-2 +1/2 +1/2 = 80

// Scenario 2: A 3*3 Sudoku is row-wise and square-wise perfect - only two of the columns have an issue - each has a value twice
// The older function will give a fitness of 81*2+9*7+16 = 241
// The newer function will give a fitness of 81-4 +1/2 +1/2 +1/2 +1/2 = 79

// Scenario 3: A 3*3 Sudoku is row-wise and square-wise perfect but column has a repeating value.
// The older function will give a fitness of 234
// The newer function will give a fitness of 71

// Both functions seem linear with a gradient of 1 - how is the new function justified?
// It is because of the different ranges of the two functions
// When the range is small, a small change as small as by 1 can cause a huge percentage change
// For example, in Scenario 2, the older fitness function says that the Sudoku is 99.1% solved, while the new function says that the Sudoku is 97.5% solved.
// Repeating this percentage calculation for different scenarios will show that the newer function puts a bigger selection pressure during Roulette Selection.
// Could I not do better? Could I not increase the selection pressure further by... let's say squaring the new fitness function?
// Two reasons:
// 1) If I really had to square, I could simply square the older fitness function and call it my new fitness function. Less work, but since professor said to try something different,
// it would be a lame trick from my side to use cubic, quadratic or any polynomial or exponential of the old function to create a new function just because squaring is not allowed from the professor.
// I have accepted the challenge of of not using any (**) operator at all. 
// 2) I think a large range of numbers for the range of a function, where most of the numbers are not even being used, is a sign of a bad function.
// It will be hard to justify this thought but if we think intuitively, if we square the old function, we will be dealing with numbers as large as 59049 as a fitness of an individual while dealing with less than 200 discrete (square) integers.
